**Skript-Paper** is a new Skript add-on that gives you even more syntaxes, using the PaperAPI.

Right now this add-on only features a bunch of events from Paper (there's currently 21 events I added) but I will be adding more expressions, conditions and effects as time goes on.

If you have any suggestions of things to add, please let me know.

#### REQUIREMENTS:
- [**Skript**](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases) (Tested with Bensku's fork 2.3 Beta4
- [**Paper**](https://papermc.io) (All of these syntaxes come from the PaperAPI so you will need to be running a Paper server instance)
